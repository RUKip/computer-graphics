This assignment was about: Shading types and texturing

Division of labour: (requirement for second year computer graphics)

Explanation added code


-- Part 1 Normal Shader --

Without the normal matrix, the colors of our cat stay the same, so the normals of base model make up the colors of the cat.
With the normal matrix the normals move with the object so if we rotate the object we also rotate the normals and the colors.

-- Part 2 Selecting shaders --
We choose to make a switch statement to select a different newly implemented shaders(Phong/Gouraud). We also added the corresponding colour values for the shaders. 
We also made sure every shader was updated accordingly. We also added these shaders in the UI so you can select them.


-- Part 3 Gourad Shader --


-- Part 4 Phong Shader --


-- Part 5 Texture mapping --
