This assignment was about: Animation OpenGL 3

Division of labour: (requirement for second year computer graphics)

Explanation added code


-- Part 1 common animation --

In the MainView we already had the QTimer, so we only had to add the start timer call at the end of InitializeGL(). 

For rotating a textured model we implemented a function call: addRotationModel which gets an instance of transformations(for each object a different one) so we can add to each component(xyz).
And in order to comtrol the addition we put a modulo operaion on it, otherwise it would only go up and go out of control. 

After that we loaded more meshes and textures, we did this the following way:

We loaded a model for each object, however we could reuse VAO, VBO and texcoord if we had used the model before and we loaded three different textures stored in several texData.
Then we activatd the right texture, binded it and also binded the corresponding VAOafter all that we called the draw function to finally draw the object.
One thing to mention is that we use uploadPhong with the right uniforms for each object, for the first object the uploadPhong is laready called somehwere else and is not needed to be called anymore.
The others on the other hand, do have to do it first before the draw call otherwise we use the values of the previous object.

For each object we had the following calls:

DoModelTransformation(determines the xyz place of the object and scales the object); 
addRotationModel(rotates the object around xyz);
moveObjects(moves the object to be in a specific circular motion)

Problems/difficulties:

-Drawing the correct objects didnt work for a long time, however we saw that we didnt upload the right uniforms for the object to be drawn. Fortunately, we saw this and corrected this.
-Fixed lighting, couldnt get it to work, but we made an uploadPhong() call for each object, instead of leaving it all in uploadPhong()
-Making a texture in blender was a real hassle.
